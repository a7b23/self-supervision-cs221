# Is Self-Supervision Helpful? Exploring Self-Supervision in Reinforcement Learning and Classification
Repository for course project in CS221 at Stanford

The repository contains code to run experiments on both classification and reinforcement learning as described in the report.
Please follow the README in the corresponding directory for instruction to setup the environment and run the experiments.

### Code for transfer learning experiments is [here](https://github.com/prabhat1081/self-supervision-cs221/tree/master/classification/transfer_learning)
### Code for reinforcement learning experiments is [here](https://github.com/prabhat1081/self-supervision-cs221/tree/master/openai-baselines)
### Code for experiments over MNIST is [here](https://github.com/prabhat1081/self-supervision-cs221/tree/master/classification/mnist)
